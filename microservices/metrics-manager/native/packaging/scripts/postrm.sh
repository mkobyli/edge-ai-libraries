# Undo what postinst changed outside the package's own files.
#
# A package that alters the state of the host has to be able to put it back.
# Removal clears the runtime directory; purge additionally removes the service
# account and the configuration the operator was left with.
#
# The msr module is deliberately not unloaded: something else on the machine
# may be relying on it by now, and unloading a kernel module out from under an
# unknown user is not a reasonable thing for a package removal to do.
